With inspiration from The Ugly Indian that operates in Bangalore, in December 2013, we fixed a dirty site in Alaknanda market, New Delhi. Then again cleaned the same place but a larger area, on Saturday, 23 Feb, 2014.
Our motto is 'Kaam chalu, muh band'. To know more about us check the video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oZtedS_s-A
If you'd like to help and make Delhi cleaner send us an email/tweet @cleandilli; don't worry about the paint or brushes or gloves, we bring those along.
And yes we have a facebook page. Like us to keep in touch!
