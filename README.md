With inspiration from [The Ugly Indian](http://www.theuglyindian.com/) that operates in Bangalore, in December 2013, we [fixed a dirty site in Alaknanda market, New Delhi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oZtedS_s-A). On Feb 23, 2014 - we got back to the same place but cleaned a larger area, in same time. REASON: That spot we fixed last time wasn't as dirty as the first time => IMPACT. We kept 2 dustbins in December and therefore people now threw rubbish in dustbins rather than littering.

Our motto is as derived from Ugly Indians is: 'Kaam chalu, muh band'.
